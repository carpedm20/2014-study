What compiler does
------------------

Code optimization.

1. Constant propagation

    if the variable is not changed during the excecution,
    change the variable into constant
2. Algebraic Simplification

    change multiplication (*4) to bit caculation (<< 2)
3. Copy propagation

    If left and right side of assignment is same, delete the line.
4. Common subexpression elimination

    If there is common expression in code, change it to one variable,
    and change expression into variable

    ex) (x+1) * (x+1) -> t=x+1; t*t
5. Loop invariant removal

    if the expression will not change during the loop,
    this expression can be changed into one varaible which is assigned
    before a loop starts..
6. Strength reduction

    like change multiplication(*) into accumulation(+) only if there is
    induction variable

    << ps look example in ppt >>

    This is because the cost of multiplication(*) is much more
    than accumulation(+).


Important things
----------------

1. How to ensure the correctness of calculation
2. Save cycles of lines of op codes.
3. recognize validation of syntax (error dialog)


Anatomy of a Computer
---------------------

    Program (stream of characters)
    ->
    Lexical Analyzer
    ->
    Result : stream of tokens
    ->
    Syntax Analyzer (Parser) : recognize syntax error
    ->
    Result : Parsed tree
    -> 
    Semantic Analyzer
    ->
    Result : Intermediate representation(IR) (to represent the code and parsed tree...)

    [[ since here frontend ]]
    ->
    [[ frome here backend ]]

    Code optimizer
    ->
    Result : Optimized intermediate representation(IR)
    ->
    Code generator
    ->
    Result : Assembly code (machine dependent)
