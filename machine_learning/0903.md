Why study learning
==================


Main difference between AI and ML (this is not important)
---------------------------------
- Machine learning is well defined. to find a "function", more focus on finding a function.
- AI is more aggregatitive term. 


Supervised learning
-------------------

We know x and label f of x(= f(x)) of unknown function.

Have to find a good approximation of f

- x : some representation of the input
- Feature extraction : the proces of mapping a domain element into a representation.

- x < {0,1}^n  (n : n dimension, size of vector)
- target function f(=label)

- try to find the most important value and extract those data -> feature extraction
- If the data is too big, we need to spend some time to extract best data and have to decide which one is more important than other features.
- This process is called data debugging

- seriese of conjunction and disjuction can represent any calculation (substract, aggregate ...)


Views of Learning
-----------------

* Learning is the removal of our remaining uncertainty
* Learning requires guessing a good small hypothesis class as a good start
